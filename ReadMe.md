Slack message with project info
Project Name, First draft name, Description of what you are doing and why





Project Info: We are making an app that finds the nearest coffee shops. Our app factors in the locally and privately owned business. We want the user
to know that they are supporting local business rather than national chains considering the covid-19 crisis. In addition to this we want to ensure that
the coffee shops our customer finds is suitable to their personal preferences so we are including parameters that they may check off to ensure they are 
finding a shop to their liking.

Project Name: Local Coffee Shops 

First Draft name: Local Coffee Shops

Description of what we are doing: We are using Yelp APIs to determine the star rating of stores and making sure users arent being sent to stores with less than 3.5
stars. In addition to this we are determined to using a google maps API to find the closest number of stores to the user so that they may decide where they want to
go. We are splitting up into a front end and back end team to develop this app but this does not mean each team member is exclusive to front end nor back end, we are
simply assigning beginning responsibilities. We are making this app local to San Diego and depending on its success it could potentially go national. 

And why we are doing it: We want to support local business and the most competitive coffee shops deserve to be recognized. This is why we are using Yelps API to determine our searches off stars that each business has received. During the tough times that covid has created we want to support local business over national brands and companies so that we may generate local economies that need the stimulation to stay alive.
